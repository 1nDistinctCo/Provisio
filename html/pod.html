Quite possible a sea of liquid hydrocarbons. The region was imaged earlier this month when the robotic Cassini spacecraft swooped past Saturn's cloudy moon and illuminated part of it with radar.  The dark region in the above image reflected little radar, an effect expected were the dark surface relatively flat, as expected for a liquid.   Other indications that the vast dark area is liquid include the coastline-like topology of the brighter regions, which appear to include islands, inlets, and tributary channels. The uninterrupted smoothness of much of the dark sea may indicate that the sea runs deep, with speculation holding a depth estimate of tens of meters. A hydrocarbon sea on Titan holds particular interest for exobiologists as it might be a place where life could develop.  In 2005 the Huygens probe landed on Titan and returned the first surface images.  Cassini will continue to explore Titan, as 13 more flybys are planned.</p><h1>Galaxies in the River</h1><img alt="Galaxies in the River" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2018-05-10-Galaxies-in-the-River.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Large galaxies grow by eating small ones. Even our own galaxy practices galactic cannibalism, absorbing small galaxies that get too close and are captured by the Milky Way's gravity. In fact, the practice is common in the universe and illustrated by this striking pair of interacting galaxies from the banks of the southern constellation Eridanus, The River. Located over 50 million light years away, the large, distorted spiral NGC 1532 is seen locked in a gravitational struggle with dwarf galaxy NGC 1531 (right of center), a struggle the smaller galaxy will eventually lose. Seen edge-on, spiral NGC 1532 spans about 100,000 light-years. Nicely detailed in this sharp image, the NGC 1532/1531 pair is thought to be similar to the well-studied system of face-on spiral and small companion known as M51.</p><h1>Jupiter's Inner Moons</h1><img alt="Jupiter's Inner Moons" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-1997-11-27-Jupiter's-Inner-Moons.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>The potato-shaped inner moons of Jupiter are lined-up in this mosaic "family portrait" of these tiny Jovian satellites. The individual images were recorded over the last year by NASA's Galileo spacecraft and are scaled to the moons' relative sizes. Left to right in increasing order of distance from Jupiter are Metis (longest dimension 37 miles), Adrastea (12 miles), Amalthea (154 miles), and Thebe (72 miles). All these moons orbit in the zone between Io and Jupiter's rings, are bombarded by high-energy ions within the Jovian magnetosphere, and are probably locked in synchronous rotation by Jupiter's strong gravity. Why are they shaped like potatoes? Like the asteroids and the diminutive moons of Mars, their own gravity is not strong enough to mold them into spheres.</p><h1>Spooky Star Forming Region DR 6</h1><img alt="Spooky Star Forming Region DR 6" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2004-11-01-Spooky-Star-Forming-Region-DR-6.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>How could stars form such a spooky and familiar shape as a human skull?  First, the complex process of star formation creates nebulas of many shapes and sizes -- it is human perception that identifies the skull shape.  Next, the physical reasons for the large nearly empty cavities that resemble the skull's eyes and mouth in nebula DR 6 are the strong stellar winds and energetic light emanating from about ten bright young stars in the nebula's central "nose".  The length of the central nasal bridge is about 3.5 light years.  Star forming nebula DR 6 is located about 4000 light years away toward the constellation of Cygnus.  The Spitzer Space Telescope took the above image last year in four infrared colors.  The perhaps-perceived eeriness of nebula DR 6 commemorates today being historically spooky All Hallow's Day, which follows All Hallow's Eve or "Halloween".</p><h1>Light Bridges on the Sun</h1><img alt="Light Bridges on the Sun" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2000-05-22-Light-Bridges-on-the-Sun.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Bridges the length of a planet can form on the Sun in a matter of hours.  Known as light bridges, these structures may form as large sunspot groups decay.  Above, one of the sharpest photographs of the Sun ever taken shows two such light bridges that appeared late last month.  The 5000-kilometer long bridges connect moderately dark penumbral regions across the cool abyss of two dark sunspot umbras.  A movie shows that material tends more to rise from below and fall rather than to cross the light bridges.  Bright bubbling granules surround the sunspot group.  The impressive details on this recently released picture from the Swedish Solar Vacuum Telescope were made possible by new adaptive optics that correct for the blurring of the Earth's atmosphere.  What eventually became of the light bridges?  As days progressed, the bridge region expanded to fill the void as the sunspots moved apart and decayed.</p><h1>A Tale of Two Nebulae</h1><img alt="A Tale of Two Nebulae" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2003-05-16-A-Tale-of-Two-Nebulae.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>This colorful telescopic view towards the northern constellation Lyra reveals dim outer regions around M57, popularly known as the Ring Nebula. While modern astronomers still refer to M57 as a planetary nebula, at one light-year across M57 is not a planet but the gaseous shroud of a dying sun-like star. Roughly the same apparent size as M57, the fainter, often overlooked barred spiral galaxy IC1296 is at the lower right and would have been referred to in the early 20th century as a spiral nebula. By chance the pair are in the same field of view, and while they appear to have similar sizes they are actually very far apart. M57 lies at a distance of a mere 2,000 light-years, well within our own Milky Way galaxy. Extragalactic IC1296 is more like 200,000,000 light-years distant or about 100,000 times farther away. Since they appear roughly similar in size, spiral nebula IC1296 must also be about 100,000 times larger than planetary nebula M57.</p><h1>Aurora Iowa</h1><img alt="Aurora Iowa" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2005-05-20-Aurora-Iowa.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>rly last Sunday morning stars were not the only lights in Iowa skies. The northern lights also shone from the heavens, extending across the midwestern USA and other locations not often graced with auroral displays. The wide-ranging auroral activity was triggered as a coronal mass ejection - an energetic cloud of particles blasted outward from the Sun a few days earlier - collided with planet Earth's magnetosphere. Alerted to conditions ripe for aurora, photographer Stan Richard recorded this aparition over Saylorville Lake, near Des Moines. Bright planet Mars in the constellation Aquarius is above the horizon near the center of the eastward-looking view. While the colorful rays seem to end just above the water, they are actually at altitudes of 100 kilometers or more.</p><h1>The Antennae Galaxies in Collision</h1><img alt="The Antennae Galaxies in Collision" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2020-12-03-The-Antennae-Galaxies-in-Collision.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Sixty million light-years away toward the southerly constellation Corvus, these two large galaxies are colliding. The cosmic train wreck captured in stunning detail in this Hubble Space Telescope snapshot takes hundreds of millions of years to play out. Cataloged as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, the galaxies' individual stars don't often collide though. Their large clouds of molecular gas and dust do, triggering furious episodes of star formation near the center of the wreckage. New star clusters and interstellar matter are jumbled and flung far from the scene of the accident by gravitational forces. This Hubble close-up frame is about 50,000 light-years across at the estimated distance of the colliding galaxies. In wider-field views their suggestive visual appearance, with extended structures arcing for hundreds of thousands of light-years, gives the galaxy pair its popular name, The Antennae Galaxies.</p><h1>Comet Clark is near the Edge</h1><img alt="Comet Clark is near the Edge" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2017-05-27-Comet-Clark-is-near-the-Edge.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Sweeping through this stunning field of view, Comet 71P/Clark really is in the foreground of these cosmic clouds. The 2 panel telescopic mosaic is color enhanced and is about 5 degrees (10 full moons) across. It captures the faint comet's position on the night of May 23/24 over 5 light-minutes from Earth, very near the line-of-sight to bright star Antares and the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex. In the frame Antares, also known as Alpha Scorpii, is at bottom center surrounded by a dusty cosmic cloud reflecting the cool giant star's yellowish light. Globular star cluster M4 shines just right of Antares, but M4 lies some 7,000 light-years away compared to Antares' 500 light-year distance. Slightly closer than Antares, Rho Ophiuchi's bluish starlight is reflected by the dust in molecular clouds toward the top. You can spot the small coma and short tail of the comet as a faint smudge near the center of the left edge of the frame. Just look for the comet's striking greenish color, produced as diatomic carbon molecules fluoresce in sunlight.</p><h1>Light From The Dark Sun</h1><img alt="Light From The Dark Sun" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-1999-08-19-Light-From-The-Dark-Sun.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Only in the fleeting darkness of a total solar eclipse is the light of the solar corona easily visible from Earth. Normally overwhelmed by the bright solar disk, the expansive corona, the sun's outer atmosphere, is an alluring sight. But the subtle details and extreme ranges in the corona's brightness discernible to the eye are notoriously difficult to photograph. In this series of images recorded from Siofok, Hungary during the total phase of the August 11 eclipse, progressively longer exposures (top left to bottom center) have been used to more faithfully capture different regions of the elusive solar corona. The final image (at bottom right) shows light from the solar disk emerging from behind the moon's edge at the end of totality.</p><h1>The Helix Nebula in Hydrogen and Oxygen</h1><img alt="The Helix Nebula in Hydrogen and Oxygen" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2019-02-13-The-Helix-Nebula-in-Hydrogen-and-Oxygen.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Is the Helix Nebula looking at you? No, not in any biological sense, but it does look quite like an eye. The Helix Nebula is so named because it also appears that you are looking down the axis of a helix. In actuality, it is now understood to have a surprisingly complex geometry, including radial filaments and extended outer loops.  The Helix Nebula (aka NGC 7293) is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The featured picture, taken in the light emitted by oxygen (shown in blue) and hydrogen (shown in red), was created from 74 hours of exposure over three months from a small telescope in a backyard of suburban Melbourne, Australia.  A close-up of the inner edge of the Helix Nebula shows complex gas knots of unknown origin.</p><h1>A Horizon with Blue and Red</h1><img alt="A Horizon with Blue and Red" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2017-12-05-A-Horizon-with-Blue-and-Red.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>What's happening on the horizon? The horizon itself, past a spinach field in Guatemala, shows not only trees but a large volcano: the Volc�n de Fuego (Volcano of Fire). The red glow at the top of the volcano is hot lava. But your eye may also be drawn to the blue circle above the horizon on the left. This circle surrounds the Moon and, together with other colors, is called a corona. A corona is caused by diffraction of light -- here moonlight -- by small water droplets in the Earth's intervening atmosphere. A break in the clouds on the right shows stars and even the planet Saturn far beyond the volcano.  Although Volc�n de Fuego frequently undergoes low-level activity, the astrophotographer considered himself lucky to capture the scene just during an explosive eruption in late September.

Oddly - most of them are spiral galaxies. This rich cluster of galaxies, named CL 0939+4713, is almost half way across the visible universe. Photos like this indicate that clusters in the past contained a higher fraction of spirals than do nearby clusters which are usually dominated by elliptical galaxies.</p><h1>Planetary Nebula Mz3: The Ant Nebula</h1><img alt="Planetary Nebula Mz3: The Ant Nebula" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2021-04-25-Planetary-Nebula-Mz3:-The-Ant-Nebula.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Why isn't this ant a big sphere?  Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star featured here at the nebula's center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star's own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.  Since the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, astronomers hope that increased understanding of the history of this giant space ant can provide useful insight into the likely future of our own Sun and Earth.</p><h1>Comet Ikeya-Zhang Brightens</h1><img alt="Comet Ikeya-Zhang Brightens" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2002-03-07-Comet-Ikeya-Zhang-Brightens.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>In the last week, Comet Ikeya-Zhang has become bright enough to be just visible to the unaided eye. Based on its present activity, observers are optimistic that Ikeya-Zhang will become substantially brighter. This composite color image from March 3rd, captured with a wide-field telescope, shows this active comet's bright, condensed coma and a delightful array of subtle structures in its developing tail. The bluish tail stretches for 5 degrees or so against a background of stars in the constellation Pisces. In the coming days look for the comet hanging low in the western evening sky (below a bright yellowish Mars), eventually becoming difficult to see in the March twilight. But after April begins, Ikeya-Zhang will become a predawn object climbing higher into the morning sky as the month progresses. Cataloged as comet C/2002 C1, improved orbit determinations now make it seem very likely that Comet Ikeya-Zhang has been around here before. Refined calculations indicate this comet's last trip through the inner Solar System was 341 years ago, in 1661, when it was recorded as a bright comet.</p><h1>Astronomy Quilt of the Week</h1><img alt="Astronomy Quilt of the Week" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2003-10-17-Astronomy-Quilt-of-the-Week.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Tomorrow's picture: moon shot  &lt; | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | &gt;  Authors &amp; editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) &amp; Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Web Site Statements, Warnings, and Disclaimers NASA Official: Jay Norris.

Of the star trails visible in this night-long exposure, the bright short arc in the upper left is due to Polaris, the north star. The breaks seen near the beginning of the fireball trail itself were produced by a shutter rotating 15 times a second. In all, three stations recorded the dazzling streak and their combined tracking information has revealed details of the meteor's brief atmospheric flight and previous interplanetary voyage. For example, the luminous trail is measured to begin at an altitude of 81.9 kilometers and covered 71.1 kilometers in 6.7 seconds. The projected prior orbit for the meteoroid corresponds to one typical for Apollo class asteroids which can cross Earth's orbit. In forty years of operations the European Network has multistation recordings of less than 10 or so fireballs as bright as this one. It is thought likely that a small (a few hundred grams) meteorite survived this fiery fall to Earth and landed near the Czech-Poland border.</p><h1>Noctilucent Clouds Over Sweden</h1><img alt="Noctilucent Clouds Over Sweden" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-2007-10-28-Noctilucent-Clouds-Over-Sweden.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>Sometimes it's night on the ground but day in the air.  As the Earth rotates to eclipse the Sun, sunset rises up from the ground.  Therefore, at sunset on the ground, sunlight still shines on clouds above.   Under usual circumstances, a pretty sunset might be visible, but unusual noctilucent clouds float so high up they can be seen well after dark.   Pictured above last month, a network of noctilucent clouds cast a colorful but eerie glow after dusk near Vallentuna, Sweden.   Although noctilucent clouds are thought to be composed of small ice-coated particles, much remains unknown about them.  Satellites launched to help study these clouds includes Sweden's Odin and NASA's AIM. Recent evidence indicates that at least some noctilucent clouds result from freezing water exhaust from Space Shuttles.</p><h1>Barsoom</h1><img alt="Barsoom" height="600" src="pictures_2021-12-01 22:18:10.414889/nasa-pod-1995-07-17-Barsoom.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle" width="800"/><p>July 17, 1995    Barsoom  Picture Credit: NASA,Viking Project  Explanation:  "Yes, I have been to Barsoom again ..." begins John Carter in Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1913 science fiction classic "The Gods of Mars". In Burroughs' novels describing Carter's adventures on Mars, "Barsoom" is the local name for the red planet. Long after Burroughs' stories were published, Mars has continued to capture the imagination of science fiction writers as a popular location for extraterrestrial adventures.

The image was made by the EIT camera onboard the SOHO spacecraft, a space observatory which can continuously observe the Sun. Eleven times ionized iron is atomic iron with eleven of its electrons stripped away. Here the electrons are stripped by the frantic collisions with other atoms and electrons which occur at the extreme temperatures in the Solar Corona. Since electrons are negatively charged, the resulting ionized iron atom is highly positively charged. Astronomer's "shorthand" for eleven times ionized iron is written "Fe XII", the chemical symbol for iron followed by a Roman numeral 12 (Fe I is neutral iron).</p>
